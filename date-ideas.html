                <h2>Why Group Dates Matter</h2> 
                <p>Group dates and socializing play a vital role in building meaningful connections and enhancing well-being. Group dates offer a relaxed, low-pressure environment where people can get to know each other naturally, making it easier to reveal true personalities and social dynamics. They provide safety, fun, and opportunities to form both romantic relationships and friendships, expanding social circles in a comfortable setting.</p> 
  
                <h2>The Financial Challenge</h2> 
                <p>College students often face financial challenges when it comes to dating due to limited budgets and competing priorities. Many are juggling tuition fees, rent, textbooks, and daily living expenses, leaving little disposable income for social activities. Since dating often involves costs like meals, movies, or events, these expenses can quickly add up and feel burdensome.</p> 
                <p>Additionally, many students work part-time or rely on financial aid, which may not provide consistent or sufficient income. This unpredictability makes it hard to plan dates or commit to expensive outings. Peer pressure and social expectations to “keep up” with dating trends can also add stress, making students feel like they need to spend more than they can afford to fit in or impress.</p>
